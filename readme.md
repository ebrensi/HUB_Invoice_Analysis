# HUB Invoice Analysis
This repo is for Mikayla's project to determine a better room rental pricing scheme.  The current method involves hourly rates tiered by renter type (part-time member,  full-time member, non-member), and various discounts when the price determined using current rates seems too high.  Mikayla wants a more consistent rate scheme that works without needing discounts.

In order to do this we look at actualy income from room rental invoices over the last year, which give us a sense of what the rooms are worth.

The orignal invoices are in the form of Excel (.xlsx) sheets combined into two workbooks.
